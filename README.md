BSLearn is an Android app designed as part of my final project at university to help people learn British Sign Language. 

The app is still considered a prototype and is not completely finalised, all the features however are functional.

# How to run:

1. **Clone this repo**. You must first clone this repo. A guide on how to do so can [be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

2. **Android Device**. The apps requires an Android mobile device to run, you can either use a physical device or emulate one.

3. **Dependences**. Gradle will automatically aquire all the relevant dependencies needed to run the app.
